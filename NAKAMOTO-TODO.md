## 🔧 Implementation Still Needed

### High Priority — Before Testnet

1. **Hard Fork Migration Mechanism**
   - Dual-mode dispatch in ConsensusManager (BFT below fork ordinal, Nakamoto above)
   - Load existing chain state (balances, state channels, metagraph snapshots) at fork point
   - Genesis time derivation from fork ordinal + slot duration
   - `epochProgress` continuation: `forkEpochProgress + floor((currentSlot - forkSlot) / 60)`
   - This is the biggest remaining piece — all current testing uses fresh genesis

2. ~~**Disable BFT Daemons in Nakamoto Mode**~~ ✅ (af15c077, bde17768, 5ec6ac46)
   - Nakamoto-specific Daemons: no-op EventGossipDaemon, drops DownloadDaemon + BFT gossip
   - BFT P2P routes (gossip, event-gossip, consensus) disabled via HttpApi isNakamotoMode flag
   - Debug logging cleaned: println→logger, emoji removed, high-freq demoted to debug
   - Services.make still creates full consensus object (unused — not worth refactoring yet)

3. **Metagraph (CL0/DL1) Nakamoto Support**
   - Current implementation is GL0-only
   - CL0 needs same VRF+LDD+attestation pattern (1:1 component reuse per scope doc)
   - DL1 (data metagraphs) — same pattern
   - Per-metagraph GossipSub topics: `/tessellation/cl0/<metagraph-id>/snapshots`

4. **Gossip Layer: Replace Tier 1/2 with Sidecar**
   - Current: sidecar handles Nakamoto topics only, old gossip still runs for everything else
   - Target: all gossip through sidecar (events, blocks, peer discovery)
   - Need: Event gossip via GossipSub, Kademlia DHT for peer discovery (replace seedlist-only)
   - Sidecar currently uses mDNS (local only) — needs bootstrap nodes for multi-host

5. **Stake-Proportional VRF**
   - Currently equal-weight (`1/N`) — every seedlist peer has same probability
   - Target: `threshold = 1 - (1 - f(δ))^relativeStake`
   - Read from `GlobalSnapshotInfo.activeDelegatedStakes` + `activeNodeCollaterals`
   - StakeRegistry.stakeWeighted already stubbed

### Medium Priority — Testnet Hardening

6. **Proactive MPT Rollback on Fork Switch**
   - MptUndoJournal exists and records deltas, but `unapplyTo` not yet wired in NakamotoSyncDaemon
   - Currently relies on self-healing (detect divergence → full resync)
   - Need: on reorg in chainStore, call `journal.unapplyTo(commonAncestorOrdinal)` before accepting new fork
   - Required for testnet scale (100MB state, 80k trie entries — full resync too expensive)

7. **Production Abandonment on Better Gossip**
   - ProductionGate infrastructure exists but threshold-based abandonment not wired
   - Need: ChainSelection.compare incoming vs in-progress, abandon if incoming wins
   - SnapshotLeaderLoop checks Deferred at pre-sign and pre-publish checkpoints

8. **Genesis Time Discovery for Validators**
   - Currently requires `NAKAMOTO_GENESIS_TIME_MS` env var
   - Should derive from peer API (e.g., slot certificate + slot duration in /latest response)
   - Or persist to shared state accessible via `/cluster/genesis-time` endpoint

9. **Mempool Reinsertion on Finalize**
   - Events from orphaned fork branches need recycling back to mempool
   - State-dependent revalidation against finalized state
   - `claimedBy` tracking for pending vs orphaned events
   - NakamotoChainStore.finalize currently prunes chains but doesn't recycle events

10. **Configurable Finality Mode**
    - Small clusters (≤3): depth-only (attestation can't reach 2/3 with 2 nodes)
    - Medium clusters: optimistic attestation (current implementation)
    - Large clusters: VRF-sortitioned attestation committees (future)
    - Config flag: `nakamoto.finality = { mode: attestation | depth | auto }`

### Low Priority — Post-Testnet

11. **Content-Addressed MPT (Ethereum-style)**
    - Current: mutable in-memory `InMemoryMerklePatriciaProducer` with stateRef
    - Target: content-addressed trie nodes in KV store keyed by hash
    - Fork switching = change root pointer, structural sharing, GC unreachable
    - Eliminates all MPT non-determinism issues permanently
    - Biggest refactor but best long-term solution

12. **Superblock Proofs (NIPoPoW-style)**
    - LDD's slot-gap threshold serves as difficulty certificate
    - Enables logarithmic light client proofs (~5,100 headers vs 1.43M full chain)
    - Research track from dilf4s paper — deferred

13. **VRF-Sortitioned Attestation Committees**
    - Full-set attestation doesn't scale past ~100 nodes
    - VRF-based committee selection for attestation duty
    - Smaller, rotating committees with same security guarantees

14. **Two-Level Finality (GL0 + Metagraph)**
    - Metagraph-local fast finality + GL0 hard finality
    - Cross-metagraph operations wait for GL0
    - Metagraph snapshot resubmission on GL0 orphaning
